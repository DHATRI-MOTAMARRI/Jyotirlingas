<p>Trimbakeshwar Shiva Temple (श्री त्र्यंबकेश्वर ज्योतिर्लिंग मंदिर) is an ancient Hindu temple in the town of Trimbak, in the 
    Trimbakeshwar tehsil in the Nashik District of Maharashtra, India, 28 km from the city of Nashik and 40 km from 
    Nashik road. It is dedicated to the Hindu god Shiva and is one of the twelve jyotirlingas where the Hindu 
    genealogy registers at Trimbakeshwar, Maharashtra are kept. The origin of the sacred Godavari River is near 
    Trimbak.</p>

<p>Kusavarta kunda (sacred pond) in the temple premises, built by Shrimant Sardar Raosaheb Parnerkar who was the 
    Fadnavis of Indore State, is the source of the Godavari River, the second longest river in India. A bust of 
    Sardar Fadnavis and his wife can be seen on the edge of the kunda. The current temple was built by Peshwa Balaji 
    Baji Rao after it was destroyed by Mughal ruler Aurangzeb.</p>
