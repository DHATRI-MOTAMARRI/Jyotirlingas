<p>Kashi Vishwanath Temple is a Hindu temple dedicated to Shiva. It is located in Vishwanath Gali, in Varanasi, 
    Uttar Pradesh, India. The temple is a Hindu pilgrimage site and is one of the twelve Jyotirlinga shrines. The 
    presiding deity is known by the names Vishwanath and Vishweshwara literally meaning Lord of the Universe.</p>

<p>According to several historical accounts, the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb ordered the demolition of the Hindu temple 
    in 1669. Subsequently, in 1678, the Gyanvapi Mosque was built on its site, but Hindu pilgrims continued to 
    visit the remnants of the temple. The current structure was constructed on an adjacent site by the Maratha ruler 
    Ahilyabai Holkar of Indore in 1780.</p>

<p>In 2021, a major redevelopment of the temple complex was completed, and the Kashi Vishwanath Dham Corridor 
    connecting the Ganga river with the temple was inaugurated by Prime Minister Modi, leading to a many-fold 
    increase in visitors. It has become one of the most visited Hindu temples in India, with an average 45,000 
    pilgrims per day in 2023. The total assets of the temple, were estimated to be more than â‚¹6 crores in 2024.</p>
