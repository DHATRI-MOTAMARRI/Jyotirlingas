<p>Nageshwar Temple is a Hindu temple dedicated to the Hindu god Shiva located on Dwarka, Gujarat, India. one of the 
   legendary temples mentioned in the Shiva Purana and is one of the twelve Jyotirlingas. Nageshvara jyotirlinga is 
   situated in a forest called Daarukavanam In Gujarat</p>

<p>According to Shiv Mahapuraan, Brahma (The Creator) and Vishnu (The Preserver) once had a disagreement about which 
   of them was supreme. To test them, Shiva pierced the three worlds as an immeasurable pillar of light, the 
   Jyotirlinga. Vishnu and Brahma parted company to determine the extent of each end of the pillar. Brahma, who had 
   set off upward, lied that he had discovered the upper end of the pillar, but Vishnu, who had gone in the direction 
   of the base of the pillar, admitted that he had not. Shiva then appeared as a second Jyotirlinga and cursed 
   Brahma, telling him that he would have no place in the ceremonies. The Jyotirlinga is the supreme indivisible 
   reality from which Shiva appears. Jyothirlinga shrines commemorate this time when Shiva appeared. It was 
   believed that there were originally sixty-four jyotirlingas. Twelve are considered to be especially auspicious and 
   holy. Each of the twelve sites takes the name of the presiding deity and each is considered a separate 
   manifestation of Shiva. At all these sites, the primary deity is a lingam representing the beginning less and 
   endless Stambha pillar, symbolizing the Shiva's infinite nature.[5][6][7] The twelve jyothirlinga are Somnath in 
   Gujarat, Mallikarjuna at Srisailam in Andhra Pradesh, Mahakaleswar at Ujjain in Madhya Pradesh, Omkareshwar in 
   Madhya Pradesh, Kedarnath in Himalayas, Bhimashankar in Maharashtra, Viswanath at Varanasi in Uttar Pradesh, 
   Triambakeshwar in Maharashtra, Vaidyanath at Deoghar in Jharkhand, Aundha Nagnath temple in Maharashtra, 
   Rameshwar at Rameswaram in Tamil Nadu and Grishneshwar at Aurangabad in Maharashtra.</p>
