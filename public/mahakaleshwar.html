<p>Mahakaleshwar Jyotirlinga (IPA: [mahākāleśvara]) is a Hindu temple dedicated to Shiva and is one of the twelve 
    Jyotirlingas, shrines which are said to be the most sacred abodes of Shiva. It is located in the ancient city of 
    Ujjain in the state of Madhya Pradesh, India. The temple is situated on the side of the holy river Shipra. 
    The presiding deity, Shiva in the lingam form is believed to be Swayambhu, deriving currents of power (Shakti) 
    from within itself as against the other images and lingams that are ritually established and invested with 
    mantra-shakti.

    Madhya Pradesh has two Jyotirlingas, the second one, Omkareshwar Jyotirlinga, is situated about 140 km south of 
    Mahakaleshwar Jyotirlinga.</p>
