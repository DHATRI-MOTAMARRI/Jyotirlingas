<p>Sri Bhramaramba Mallikarjuna Temple (IAST: MallikƒÅrjuna) or Srisailam Temple is a Hindu temple dedicated to the 
    deities Shiva and Parvati, located at Srisailam in the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh. It is significant to the 
    Hindu sects of both Shaivism and Shaktism as this temple is referred to as one of the twelve Jyotirlingas of 
    Shiva and as one of the eighteen Shakti Pithas, centres of the Hindu Goddess. Shiva is worshiped as 
    Mallikarjuna, and is represented by the lingam. His consort Parvati is depicted as Bhramaramba.</p>

<p>When Shiva and Parvati decided to find suitable brides for their sons. Shiva got Buddhi (intellect) and Siddhi 
    (spiritual power) married to Ganesha. Kartikeya on his return was enraged and went away to stay alone on Mount 
    Krauncha in Palani in the name of Kumara brahmachari. On seeing his father coming over to pacify him, he tried 
    to move to another place, but on the request of the Devas, stayed close by. The place where Shiva and Parvati 
    stayed came to be known as Srisailam.

    As per Hindu legend, the presiding deity in the form of Linga (an iconic form of Shiva) was worshipped with 
    jasmine (locally called in Telugu as Mallika), leading to the name of presiding deity as Mallikarjuna.</p>
